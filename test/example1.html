<h1>On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related systems.</h1>
<h2>Kurt Godel 1931.</h2>

<p class="cortexit_button_after">
The development of mathematics towards greater exactness has, as is well-known, lead
to formalization of large areas of it such that you can carry out proofs by following a few
mechanical rules. The most comprehensive current formal systems are the system of
Principia Mathematica (PM) on the one hand, the Zermelo-Fraenkelian axiom-system
of set theory on the other hand. These two systems are so far developed that you
can formalize in them all proof methods that are currently in use in mathematics, i.e.
you can reduce these proof methods to a few axioms and deduction rules. Therefore,
the conclusion seems plausible that these deduction rules are sufficient to decide all
mathematical questions expressible in those systems. We will show that this is not true,
but that there are even relatively easy problem in the theory of ordinary whole numbers
that can not be decided from the axioms. This is not due to the nature of these systems,
but it is true for a very wide class of formal systems, which in particular includes all
those that you get by adding a finite number of axioms to the above mentioned systems,
provided the additional axioms don’t make false theorems provable.

Let us first sketch the main intuition for the proof, without going into detail and
of course without claiming to be exact. The formulae of a formal system (we will
restrict ourselves to the PM here) can be viewed syntactically as finite sequences of
the basic symbols (variables, logical constants, and parentheses or separators), and it is
easy to define precisely which sequences of the basic symbols are syntactically correct
formulae and which are not. Similarly, proofs are formally nothing else than finite
sequences of formulae (with specific definable properties). Of course, it is irrelevant
for meta-mathematical observations what signs are taken for basic symbols, and so we
will chose natural numbers for them. Hence, a formula is a finite sequence of natural
numbers, and a proof schema is a finite sequence of finite sequences of natural numbers.
The meta-mathematical concepts (theorems) hereby become concepts (theorems) about
natural numbers, which makes them (at least partially) expressible in the symbols of the
system PM. In particular, one can show that the concepts “formula”, “proof schema”,
“provable formula” are all expressible within the system PM, i.e. one can, for example,
2come up with a formula F (v) of PM that has one free variable v (whose type is sequence
of numbers) such that the semantic interpretation of F (v) is: v is a provable formula.
We will now construct an undecidable theorem of the system PM, i.e. a theorem A for
which neither A nor ¬A is provable, as follows:
