Disperse large paragraphs of text, where words seem to blend together, into easily digestible chunks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### In large fonts, filling the screen. #

### Fluid navigation. #

### Read at your own pace. #

### Focus on one sentence or word at a time. #

### Reduces ADHD, Dyslexia, and Vision problems. #

Now you can adjust, and maybe improve the rate and quality of how you absorb information.

You are no longer at the mercy of web designers and authors that insist on writing impenetrably dense paragraphs in small fonts.

(This is an updated version of the original Cortexit Google Chrome Browser Plugin).
